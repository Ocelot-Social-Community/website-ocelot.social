**Ocelot.Social** is *open-source program code* that is freely available for running social networks.
Its development is supported by a community of programmers and interested network operators.

Our goal is to enable as many people as possible to participate in equality in online social networks.
The equality of opportunity applies both to the fundamental equality of all people and to the possibility of letting their diverse voices be heard.

Therefore we see it as desirable that as many network operators as possible offer networking, so that people can choose under which signs and which culture of moderation they want to be in the network.

At the same time, it should be possible in the future to connect these networks with each other so that every user can also connect with people from other networks. For example, by making friends or by following the contributions of users of other networks.

So we are concerned in a *network of networks* and in keeping the data as close as possible to the user and to the operator of their trust.
